# Fruit Punch

Fruit Punch was my first attempt at making a grid game in Java that has a GUI. Once you click "Enter", you can 
enter the first level and begin the game. Click on any piece and another found to swap them. If this results in 
three or more adjacent fruits, the fruits will "clear", your score will increase, and the column/row will shift 
down. You have a limited number of "moves" before the level ends, and you must reach the minimum score target
within that time. If you succeed, the next level will be unlocked. If not, you must attempt the level again.

# Next Steps

Due to time constraints, I didn't have time to add background music like I wanted. It would also be more fun if the 
game had a countdown timer! It would be nice to get feedback on this game, particularly in terms of whether each level
is too easy or too difficult. Of course, another next step is simply to add more levels.

Furthermore, I would like to revisit this project and use object-oriented programming! The code looks messy and can
be separated into classes. At the time, we had not learned how to do that yet.

Application was created in May 2016 for a school project.
